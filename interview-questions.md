# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a hash in Ruby?

Your answer: A hash in Ruby is a key:value pair. Hashes are common in hashmaps and JSON data. A key is a unique data that only 1 of it can exist. There can be multiple values, but only 1 hash.

Researched answer: A hash in Ruby is a data structure. Hashes hold data using key-value relationship. Hashes are created using symbols as keys and data types as values. Hashes can be represented like a dictionary that each keys are letters in an alphabet and easily obtainable by looking it up. Keys are the letters in the alphabet and values are the actual words in the dictionary.

2. What is a gem?

Your answer: A gem is used in Ruby as a library to allow developers access to different functinality to their codebase. Gems make it easier for developers to use these pre-built libraries so they are not re-inventing the wheel. An example of a Ruby gem is Rspec, which is used for testing Ruby code.

Researched answer: Gems in Rails are libraries that allow users to spend less time coding to accomplish different functionality within their code. Gems contain libraries that are reusable to users, so developers do not need to duplicate the same code to accomplish the same task as other developers. A popular gem for Ruby on Rails is RSpec. Rspec is a testing gem to allow developers to test their code and ensure it is working properly.

3. What is Ruby on Rails?

Your answer: Ruby is a software developer language. Rails is a framework that works with Ruby. Putting them together allow a large portion of a full-stack application to be put together. Ruby on Rails is also really good for web pages and creating websites. Ruby on Rails makes it easy to build the front-end and the back-end.

Researched answer: Ruby on Rails is an open-source web application development framework used in the Ruby language. Using Ruby on Rails makes it easy for developers, because of everything that is pre-built in it to quickly make a web application. Ruby on Rails uses MVC architecture (Model, View, and Controller). RoR uses the model and controller for the backend and the view for the frontend.

4. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

Your answer: A database holds the data using columns and rows. Relational databases uses commands like SELECT, FROM, ORDER BY, LIMIT, etc. Examples of relational databases are PostgreSQL and MySQL. There are also non-relational databases, which are different than relational databases. 

Researched answer:

5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

Your answer: Primary keys are used in databases and are the unique and only one of each primary key can exist. Each value in a database is unique by it's primary key. For example, if there is a database of millions of Facebook accounts, then it would be difficult to distinguish which belongs to who. So, a primary key is assigned to each account and allows databases to filter through each unique id.

Researched answer: A primary key is also known as primary keyword. Primary keys are unique identifiers in a relational database and can only exist one primary key. An example of a primary key is when a customer shops at a store and the customer can shop in the store multiple times. However, a primary key can be placed on the specific order at the specific time the customer came in. So if a user went to the store and bought a t-shirt one time and a pair of shoes next time, then each visit would have a primary key and unique to that specific purchase at the time. Primary keys are important, because it is the sole purpose of a relational database. Each table within a database needs primary keys to keep track and maintain unique records.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes: RESTful routes uses HTTP verbs (get, post, put, delete, patch) to the controller for CRUD actions (Create, Read, Update, Delete). RESTful routes are used to make it easier to navigate in an application using consistent URL paths.

2. JSON: JSON stands for Javascript Object notation. JSON is text-based data that is based on key-value pairs and ordered lists. JSON is popular with many databases and relational databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL has native support.

3. ERB: ERB stands for Embedded Ruby. It is an HTML file that Rails will communicate with Ruby to add content to the file and output an HTML file.

4. Params: Params is a parameter which is passed to the controller through GET or POST requests.

5. API: API stands for Application Programming Interface. It allows different software to communicate with each other. An API software allows use of data and software.
